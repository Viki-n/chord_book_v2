On the street where you live 
from My Fair Lady


E7     A6            E7        A 
I have often walked, down this street before,
            Amaj7       Cdim7              E7 
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before.
Edim7   Hm7         Dm      A 
All at  once am I, several stories high,
F#m     H7          E7                A 
Knowing I'm, on the street, where you live.

Are there lilac trees, in the heart of  town,
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town.
Does en...chantment pour, out of every door,
No, it's just, on the street, where you live.

R:
     C#                  D6            Dm                    A    A7 
And, oh, the towering feeling, just to know somehow you are near, 
          G#'  D#dim7   G#       G#7      C#             G#         C# 
The o ... ver..powering feeling, that any second you may suddenly appear.


Peo..ple stop and stare, they don't bother me.
For there's nowhere else on earth that I   would rather be.
Let the time go by, I won't care if I,
Can be  here on the street where you live.
