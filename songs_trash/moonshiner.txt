The Moonshiner 
traditional irish

============= 
            G                     C 
I've been a moonshiner for many a year 
  D                                 G 
I spent all my money on whiskey and beer 
               G                     C 
I'll go to some hollow and set up my still 
     D                                  G 
I'll make you a gallon for a two-dollar bill 
 
R: I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home 
If you don't like me, just leave me alone 
I eat when I'm hungry, I drink when I'm dry 
And if moonshine don't kill me I'll live till I die 
 
I'll go to some hollow in this count-ar-y 
Ten gallons of wash - I can go on a spree 
No woman to follow, the world is all mine 
I love none so well as I love the moonshine 
 
R: 
 
Moonshine, dear moonshine, oh, how I love thee 
You killed my poor father, but dare you try me 
Bless all the moonshiners and bless the moonshine 
Its breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine 
 
R:
