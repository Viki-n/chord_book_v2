One more cup of coffee
Bob Dylan


     Ami                                    G 
Your breath is sweet your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
     F                                           E 
your back is straight your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie
      Ami                      G 
but I don't sense affection no gratitude or love
     F                        E 
your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above.

     F                              E
*R:* One more cup of coffee for the road
F                            E                  Ami G F E 
one more cup of coffee for I go to the valley below.    

Your daddy he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade
he'll teach you how to pick a choose and how to throw the blade
and he oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude
his voice it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.

Your sister sees the future like your momma and yourself
you've never learned to read or write there's no books upon your shelf
and your pleasure know no limits your voice is like a meadowlark
but your heart is like an ocean so mysterious and dark.
