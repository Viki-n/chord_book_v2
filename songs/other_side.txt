     Ami          F           C
*R:* How long how long will I slide
G           Ami       C 
Separate my si[F]de I don't
  G                  Ami  
I don't believe it's ba[F]d
C                   G 
Slit my throat it's all I ever

Ami                          Emi
I heard your voice through a photogragh
Ami                 Emi
It thought it up it brought up the past
Ami                   Emi
Once you know you can never go back
            G              Ami
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside

G              Ami
Take it on the otherside
Take it on take it on

*R:*

Poor my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she is in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside

Take it on the otherside
Take it on take it on

*R:*

Emi
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
C 
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
   Emi
I fell and tell it that it's not my friend
           C 
I tear it down I tear it down
                    Ami
And it's born again [F][C][G]

*R:*

Ami  F      C       G                 Ami F 
How long I don't I don't believe it's bad 
C                    G         Ami
Slit my throat it's all I ever
