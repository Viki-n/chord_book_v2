Other side 
Red Hot Chili Peppers


   Am            F            C 
R: How long how long will I slide
   G         Am  F  C 
Seperate my side I don't
    G                Am F 
I don't believe it's bad
C                   G 
Slit my throat it's all I ever

Am                            Em 
I heard your voice through a photogragh
Am                          Em 
It thought it up it brought up the past
Am                     Em 
Once you know you can never go back
             G              Am 
I've got to take it on the otherside

Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the otherside

 G              Am 
Take it on the otherside
Take it on take it on

R:

Poor my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spilling my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the otherside

Scarlet starlet and she is in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I've got to take it on the otherside

Take it on the otherside
Take it on take it on

   Em 
R: Turn me on take me for a hard ride
C 
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
   Em 
I fell and tell it that it's not my friend
           C 
I tear it down I tear it down
                    Am C 
And it's born again [F][G]

R:

Am   F      C       G                 Am  F 
How long I don't I don't believe it's bad 
C                    G         Am 
Slit my throat it's all I ever
