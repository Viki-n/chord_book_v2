Robert's got a quick hand
      C                             G 
He'll look around the room he won't tell you his plan
Dmi              F 
Got a rolled cigarette
C                             G 
Hangin' out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
      Dmi                 F 
Yeah, found a six-shooter gun
       C                         G 
In his dads closet hidden with a box of fun things
Dmi               F 
I don't even know what
         C                         G 
But he's comin' for you, yeah he's comin for you, hey

             C 
You'd better run, better run
G 
Outrun my gun
Dmi                         F 
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
             C 
You'd better run, better run
G 
Faster than my bullet:/

Daddy works a long day
He'll be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
Cos' dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
The slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say your hair's on fire you must have lost your wits, yeah
