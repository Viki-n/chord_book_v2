Sinxteen Tons
Tennessee Ernie Ford


Am                       Dm         E 
Some people say a man is made outa mud
Am                    Dm            E 
A poor man's made outa muscle 'n blood...
Am                    Dm 
Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bone
Am                       E           Am 
A mind that's weak and a body that's strong

   Am               G         F        E 
R: You load sixteen tons an' whaddya get?
Am           G         F          E 
Another day older an' deeper in debt
Am                                  Dm 
Saint Peter doncha call me 'cause I can't go
Am                   E       Am 
I owe my soul to the company sto'

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
Picked up my shovel and I went to the mine
Loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said, "Well, Bless my soul!"

R.

I was born one mornin it was drizzlin rain
Fighten an trouble are my middle name
I was raised in a cane break by an old mama lion
Can't no hightoned woman make me walk the line

R.

If ya hear me a-comin' ya better step aside
A lotta men din't an' a lotta men died
With one fist of iron an' the other of steel
If the right one don' getcha then the left one will.
