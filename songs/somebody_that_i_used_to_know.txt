Somebody that I used to know
Gotye


Dmi            C        Dmi     C      Dmi    C Dmi C 
Now and then I think of when we were together       
Dmi           C                Dmi   C         Dmi C Dmi C 
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die       
Dmi    C                  Dmi       C 
Told myself that you were right for me
    Dmi     C              Dmi  C 
But felt so lonely in your company
Dmi          C                Dmi    C       Dmi   C  Dmi C 
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember       

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

     Dmi     C              A#     C
*R:* But you didn't have to cut me off
Dmi      C             A# 
Make out like it never happened
         C         Dmi 
And that we were nothing
    C            A#        C 
And I don't even need your love
        Dmi             C 
But you treat me like a stranger
         A#       C 
And that feels so rough
Dmi C              A#       C 
You didn't have to stoop so low
Dmi       C                    A# 
Have your friends collect your records
         C           Dmi 
And then change your number
  C                  A#        C 
I guess that I don't need that though
Dmi             C               A#      C 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know



Dmi C  A#  C 
Dmi             C               A#      C 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Dmi C  A#  C 
Dmi             C               A#      C 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
C 
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
                                    N.C. 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

*R:*

    Dmi     C       A#      C 
Somebody...       I used to know
    Dmi     C       A#      C 
Somebody...  That I used to know
    Dmi     C       A#      C 
Somebody...       I used to know
    Dmi                          C           A#      C 
Somebody... (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Dmi   C   A#       C 
       I used to know
Dmi  C        A#       C 
      That I used to know
Dmi   C   A#       C 
       I used to know

Somebody...
