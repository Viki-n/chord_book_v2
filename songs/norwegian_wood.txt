I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.
She showed me her room, isn't it good? Norwegian wood.

    Dmi                                    G
She asked me to stay and told me to sit anywhere,
   Dm                                           Em    A A7
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two, and then she said, It's time for bed.

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh,
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird has flown.
So I lit a fire, isn't it good? Norwegian wood.
