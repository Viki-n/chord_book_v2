I once had a girl, or should I say
#d a c# h
    C            D 
    she once had me.
She showed me her room, isn't it good?
    Norwegian wood.

    Dm 
She asked my to stay and 
                   G 
    told me to sit anywhere,
   Dm 
So I looked around and 
                             Em   A A7 
    I noticed there wasn't a chair. 

I sat on a rug, biding my time,
    drinking her wine.
We talked until two, and then she said,
    It's time for bed.

She told me she worked in the morning 
    and started to laugh,
I told her I didn't, and crawled off 
    to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke, I was alone, 
    this bird has flown.
So I lit a fire, isn't it good? 
    Norwegian wood.
