*R:* Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
    G                                    Ami
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Ami     C       G       Ami
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
G                     Emi              Ami
Please don't take him just because you can

     Ami         C
Your beauty is beyond compare
     G                Ami
With flaming locks of auburn hair
     G              Emi             Ami
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

*R:*

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

*R:*
