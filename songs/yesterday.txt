I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, Love was such an easy game to play, 
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Yesterday, Love was such an easy game to play, 
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
