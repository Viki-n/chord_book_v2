We'll meet again
The Fat Rat

C               G             Dm    Am
Suddenly you're nowhere to be found
  F               C              G
I turn around and everything has changed
C             G              Dm   Am
Looking for a way to work it out
    F                   C            G
I’m trying to find some peace to navigate


         C                G
*R:* The oak tree where I met you
        Dm             Am
and the writing on the statue
  F              C              G
I still remember every word you said
          C               G
I’m not a soldier but I’m fighting
        Dm                  Am
Can you hear me through the silence?
  F                   C               G
I won't give up cause there will be a day
               C    G Dm Am F C G
/: We’ll meet again               :/

Everything we wanted turned to gold
The path we chose, the future on our side
Never thought I’d do this on my own
But now I wield the sword you left behind

*R:*

          C            G        Dm           Am
*Bridge:* Dark for the sunrise, clouds for a blue sky
F             C          G
Space for the travelling star
C               G       Dm              Am
Strong from the inside, you're still my lifeline
F              C        G
I feel you wherever you are

                   C
*R:* + We'll meet again
