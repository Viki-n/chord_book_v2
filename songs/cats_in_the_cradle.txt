Well a child arrived just the other day
A                           E 
He came to the world in the usual way
                                   G 
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
A                          E 
He learned to walk while I was away
           D 
And he was talkin 'for I knew it and as he grew he'd say
G         Hmi         E 
I'm gonna be like you dad
    G              Hmi     E 
you know I'm gonna be like you

                                      D 
R: And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
G                       A 
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
E                            D 
When you coming home Dad,  I don't know when
    G         Hmi      E 
But we'll get together then
G                     Hmi       E 
You know we'll have a good time then.

My son turned ten just the other day
He said thanks for the ball dad c'mon lets play
Can you teach me to throw I said "not today;
I got a lot do" he said "that's okay"
And he walked away with a smile and as he did he said
"I'm gonna be like him,yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him"

R:

Well he came home from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
"Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile
"What I'd really like Dad is to borrow the car keys.
See you later can I have them please?"

R2:And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little  boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then Dad
You know we'll have a good time then.

I've long since retired my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said "I'd like to see you if you don't mind"
He said "I'd love to dad  if I could find the time"
You see, My new jobs a hassle and the kid's have the flu
But its sure nice talkin' to you dad
Its been sure nice talkin' to you
         D 
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
     G        Hmi       E 
He'd grown up just like me
   G       Hmi       E 
My boy was just like me
