Little darling
the smiles returning to their faces
little darling
it feels like years since it's been here.

Here comes the sun

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
little darling
it feels like years since it's been clear.

Here comes the sun
here comes the sun
and I say it's all right.

Here comes the sun
here comes the sun
and I say it's all right
it's all right.
