Hmi                 Emi 
All those beautiful people
          A 
I want to have them,
          F# 
I want to have them all
Hmi                 Emi 
All those porcelain models
        D                 A 
If only I could make them fall

      Hmi             G 
Be my heart a well of love
        Emi         D 
Flowing free so far above

A wintry eve
            G 
Once upon a tale
        Hmi 
An Ugly Duckling
          A 
Lost in a verse
              G 
Of a sparrows carol
             D 
Dreaming the stars

(violin solo)

      Hmi             G 
Be my heart a well of love
        Emi         D 
Flowing free so far above

In my world
            G 
Love is for poets
          Hmi            A 
Never the famous balcony scene
             G 
Just a dying faith
                D 
On the heaven's gate

(keyboard solo)

        Hmi             G 
Crystal pond awaits the lorn
        D 
Tonight another morn for the 
F#            Hmi 
lonely one is born

(guitar solo)
