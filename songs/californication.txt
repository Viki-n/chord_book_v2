Californication 
Red Hot Chili Peppers


main riff:

Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind’s elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It’s Californication

It’s the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
It’s understood that Hollywood
sells Californication

R:

Am 
Pay your surgeon very well
   Fmaj7 
To break the spell of aging
Am 
Celebrity skin is this your chin
   Fmaj7 
Or is that war your waging

Am           Fmaj7 
First born unicorn
Am             Fmaj7 
Hard core soft porn
C            G     Dm    Am 
Dream of Californication 
C            G     Dm 
Dream of Californication


Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It’s Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it’s made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderon’s not far away
It’s Californication

R:

Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl’s guitar
They’re just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn’t save the world
From Californication
