Border Reiver

Ami 
Southern bound from Glasgow town
      Ami7           F 
She’s shining in the sun
            Ami 
My Scotsoun Lassie
C             F 
On the border run
      Ami 
We’re whistling down the hillsides
    Ami7           F 
and tearing up the climbs
           Ami     C 
I’m just a thiever 
         F 
Stealing time
              Ami 
In the border reiver

Eight hundred thousand on the clock
And plenty more to go
Crash box and lever
She needs the heel and toe
She’s not too cold in winter
But she cooks me in the heat
I’m a six foot driver
But you can’t adjust the seat
In the border reiver


      F           C
*R:* "Sure as the sunrise"
                 Emi           F 
That’s what they say about the Albion
             C 
"Sure as the sunrise"
                 Emi           F 
That’s what they say about the Albion
         Dmi 
She’s an Albion
         Ami 
She’s an Albion

The Ministry don’t bother me
My paperwork’s alright
They can’t touch me
I got my sleep last night
It’s knocking out a living wage in 1969
I’m just a thiever
Stealing time
In the border reiver
