I don't like walking around this old and empty house.
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even trust myself
It's killing me to see you this way

,[F],,[G] Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well tell her that I miss our little talks.
Soon it will all be over, buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young and full of life and full of love.
Some days I don't know If I am wrong or right.
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear.

Don't listen to a word I say, Hey!
    Ami         F         C     G 
The screams all sound the same. Hey!

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear.
All that's left is a ghost of you.
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do,
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep. Hey!
