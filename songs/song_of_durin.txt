Song of Durin
Clamavi De Profundis


    Am        G
The world was young,
    C         Am
the mountains green
   F         G       Em       Am
No stain yet on, the moon was seen
   Am         G        Em        Am
No words were laid, on stream or stone
     F     G         Em      Am
When Durin woke, and walked alone
                      F         G
He named the nameless hills and dells
   Am         C     F      G
He drank from yet untasted wells
   F           Am        C     G
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere
    Dm    C        F      G
And saw a crown of stars appear
   Am    G     C      F
As gems upon a silver thread
 F        G       Em     Am
Above the shadows of his head

    Am        G         C         F
The world was fair, the mountains tall,
   Dm    G      Em       Am
In Elder Days before the fall
   Am     G             Dm
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond
         C        F     G
And Gondolin, who now beyond
    Am      F         G       C
The Western Seas have passed away:
    F         G       Em      Am
the world was fair in Durin's Day.

  Am      F      C      G
A king he was on carven throne
   Am   G        F        G
In many-pillared halls of stone
     Am     F        C      Am
With golden roof and silver floor,
    F        C     Am       G
And runes of power upon the door.
    Am       F       C        G
The light of sun and star and moon
   Dm      F        Am      G
In shining lamps of crystal hewn
  Am        G        C        F
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night
      F         G    Em       Am
There shone for ever fair and bright.

      Am     F      C     G
There hammer on the anvil smote,
      Am     F          C      G
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;
      Am         F
There forged was blade,
    C         Am
and bound was hilt;
    F      C          Am    G
The delver mined, the mason built.
      Am     F          C    G
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,
    Dm    F            Am      G
And metal wrought like fishes' mail,
Am          G        C       F
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
    Dm      G           Em      Am
And shining spears were laid in hoard.


  Am      C         Dm      Em
Unwearied then were Durin's folk;
  Am        C         F C   G
Beneath the mountains music woke:
    Am      G           C         F
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,
    F      G         Em       Am
And at the gates the trumpets rang.

     Am      G         C         F
The world is gray, the mountains old
    F       G       Em    Am
The forge's fire is ashen cold
   Am      G                C
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls
    F        G         Em      Am
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls
    Am     F     Dm      Em
The shadow lies upon his tomb
   Am  C     F      G
In Moria, in Khazad-d\^um
     F        Am     Dm    C G
But still the sunken stars appear
    Dm      C        F     G
In dark and windless Mirrormere
      Am       G        C      Dm
There lies his crown in water deep
     F     G     Em         Am
Till Durin wakes again from sleep
