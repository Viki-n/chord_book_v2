Numb
Linkin park


Em                            C
  I'm tired of being what you want me to be
G                         D
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
Em                         C
  Don't know what you're expecting of me
    G                                     C     D
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
      Em              G                 C    D
Every step I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

     Em             C                      G
*R:* I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               D                    Em
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             C                   G
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                D                   Em
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

*R:*

                D          Em  D/F# G  Hm7  C
*Bridge:* And I know I may end up   failing too
      D              H                         Hsus4
But I know. You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

           Emi            C                      G
*R:* +  /: I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                         D
