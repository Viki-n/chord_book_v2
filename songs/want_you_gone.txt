Want you gone
Jonathan Coulton (from Portal 2)


A 
Well here we are again.
D           E 
It's always such a pleasure.
A 
Remember when you tried
D          E 
to kill me twice?
A 
Oh how we laughed and laughed.
D        E 
Except I wasn't laughing.
A 
Under the circumstances
D         C# 
I've been shockingly nice.

F#                     H 
You want your freedom? Take it.
F#                       H 
That's what I'm counting on.
F#                 H 
I used to want you dead but
D          E        A 
Now I only want you gone.

She was a lot like you.
(Maybe not quite as heavy).
Now little Caroline
is in here too.
One day they woke me up -
So I could live forever.
It's such a shame the same
will never happen to you.

You've got your short sad life left.
That's what I'm counting on.
I'll let you get right to it -
Now I only want you gone.


Goodbye my only friend.
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny if it
weren't so sad.
Well you have been replaced.
I donâ€™t need anyone now.
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad.

Go make some new disaster.
That's what I'm counting on.
You're someone else's problem.
Now I only want you gone.
D          E        A      F#mi 
Now I only want you gone.  
D          E        A 
Now I only want you gone.
