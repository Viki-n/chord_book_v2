I was twenty-four years old when I met the woman I would call my own
       Emi                C       G           C               D       Emi 
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old in that house that your brother bought ya
       Emi             C             D                           Emi 
On the summer day when I proposed, I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
      Emi                      C          G   C         D        Emi 
And I asked her father but her daddy said no, you can't marry my daughter

R: She and I went on the run, don't care about religion
G                   C       G     C           D       Emi 
I'm gonna marry the woman I love, down by the Wexford border
G             C    G        D             C   G 
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
    G                     C       G    C           D       Emi 
She took my name and then we were one, down by the Wexford border

Well I met her at Guy's in the second world war
\quad and she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before the moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose and we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old, five sons and three daughters

R:

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair, |over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs, |you know Nancy I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town, |I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground, |there's no difference I assure ya

R:
