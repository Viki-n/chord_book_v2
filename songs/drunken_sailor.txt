2 Put him in the longboat til he’s sober
3 Pull out the plug and wet him all over
4 Leave him there and make him bale ’er
5 Put him in the scuppers with a hosepipe on him
6 Heave him by the leg in a running bowline
7 Tie him to the taffrail when she’s yardarm under
8 Threaten him with sharks till he’s sober
9 Keelhaul him, keelhaul him
10 Put him in the bilge and make him drink it
11 Rub him really smooth until he guffaws
12 Run him up the mast with the Jolly Roger
13 Shave his belly with a rusty razor
14 Put him in bed with the captains daughter
15 Thats what we’ll do with a drunken sailor
