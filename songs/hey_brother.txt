Hey  brother! There's an  endless road to rediscover.
Em                     C       G         D         Em
Hey  sister! Know the  water's sweet but blood is  thicker.
D            G         C       D
Oooh, if the sky comes falling down, for you, there's
G6              C                Em
nothing in this world I wouldn't do.

Hey  brother! Do you  still believe in one  another?
Hey  sister! Do you  still believe in love?  I wonder
Oooh, if the sky comes falling down, for you, there's
nothing in this world I wouldn't do.

Oooh, if the sky comes falling down, for you, there's
G6              C                Em
nothing in this world I wouldn't do.

Hey  brother! There's an  endless road to re-  discover.
Hey  sister! Do you  still believe in love?  I wonder
Oooh, if the sky comes falling down, for you, there's
nothing in this world I wouldn't do.
