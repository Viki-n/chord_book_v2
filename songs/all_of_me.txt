All of me

G 
All of me
              B7 
Why not take all of me
E7 
Can't you see
              Am 
I'm no good without you

B7 
Take my lips
          Em 
I want to lose them
A7 
Take my arms
            Am    D7 
I'll never use them

G 
Your goodbye
              B7 
Left me with eyes that cry
E7                     Am 
How can I go on dear without you

That once was my heart

So why not take all of me
