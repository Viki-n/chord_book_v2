The Islander 
Nightwish


   Bm           Bm9 
An old man by a seashore 
G 
at the end of days
A         G 
Gazes the horizon with 
 A               Bm 
sea wind in his face

Tempest-tossed island, 
seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted and a 
ship without a name

Sea without a shore 
For the banished one unheard
Alight is the people lying 
at the end of world

Showing the way Lighting
hope in their hearts
Once in their travels all 
come from afar

  Bm           G    D   A   Bm 
R:This is the long for-got-ten 
  G           D         Em    Bm 
light at the end of the world 
    G  D   A   Bm 
Ho-ri-zon cry-ing 
    G             D           Em 
the tears we left behind long ago

The albatross is flying There's 
hate in their greed
The time before me one day when 
all was the sea

Princess in the tower
Children in the field
Life giving it all And all
of the universe

Oh, now is as a memory
The ghost in the fog
He sets the sails
And laughs to say 
farewell to the world

Anchor to the water
Sea be far below
Laughing in the heat And a 
smile beneath his brow

R: (2x)
