Point of no return
Andrew Lloyd Webber (from The Phantom of the Opera)


               Gmi Fmi  Fmi  D#mi
{\it Phantom:} You have come here
Gmi   Fmi          Fmi     D#mi 
In pursuit of your deepest urge
A#    Fmi          C#mi            Hmi 
In pursuit of that wish which till now
         Ami     Gmi 
Has been silent, silent.
A H    G#      F#mi   A 
I have brought you    
         H            G#       F#mi 
That our passions may fuse and merge
C#      G#mi        Emi        Dmi       Emi 
In your mind you've already succumbed to me
        F#mi  G#mi 
dropped all defenses
   Emi               Dmi        Cmi 
Completely succumbed to me, now you are here with me
Cmi 
No [A#mi]second thoughts
         G#mi   Gmi 
You've decided, decided.


Fmi               C7         Fmi 
Past the point of no return  
            F 
No backward glances
    C#              D#7            G#  C7 C 
Our games of make belive are at an end    
Fmi                 C7      Fmi              F 
Past all thought of "if" or "when", no use resisting
 C#                 D#7              G#     G#7 
Abandon thought and let the dream descend   
            C#                    F# 
What raging fire shall flood the soul'
     F#7     H                 Hmi 
What rich desire unlocks its door'
             F#             Gmi7  C 
What sweet seduction lies before us'

Fmi               C7        Fmi
Past the point of no return 
          F 
The final threshold
     C#            D#7             G#      G#7 
What warm unspoken secrets will we learn   
  C#                F# C7 
beyond the point of no re[Fmi]turn'

{\it Christine:} You have brought me
To that moment where words run dry
To that moment where speech disappears
Into silence
Silence.
I have come here,
Hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining
Defenseless and silent,
Now I am here with you,
No second thoughts,
I've decided
Decided.

Past the point of no return
No going back now
Our passion-play has now at last begun.
Past all thought of right or wrong
One final question
How long should we two wait before we're one'
When will the blood begin to race'
The sleeping bud burst into bloom'
When will the flames at last consume us'

             Gmi               D7 
{\it Both:} Past the point of no return,
Gmi       G 
The final threshold
G7  D# 
The bridge is crossed
   F7                 A# 
So stand and watch it burn
      D#                  G# D7 
We've passed the point of no re[Gmi]turn.
