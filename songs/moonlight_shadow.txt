Moonlight shadow
Mike Oldfield


    Ami                F
The last that ever she saw him
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
   Ami                   F
He passed on worried and warning
G                 C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
C                     G
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Ami  F          G
Far away on the other side.
       C                         G
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
        Ami           F           G
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

*Bridge:* I stay
C G
I pray
  C          F      G
I see you in heaven far away
C G
I stay
C G
I pray
  C          F      G
I see you in heaven One day

Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was light in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through

            Ami F           G
*Bridge:* + Far away on the other side.

Ami F G

C                         G
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
    C                       G
The night was heavy but the air was alive
        Ami           F           G
But she couldn't find how to push through
                  C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
                  C         G
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Ami F           G
Far away on the other side.
