Nothing Else Matters 
Metallica


#e f# e
So close no matter how far
#d e d e
Couldn't be much more from the heart
#f# g d d e edc
Forever trusting who we are
#g f# g f# e
And nothing else matters

#e f# g d e
Never opened myself this way
#d e h d e
Life is ours, we live it our way
#a h a f# e f# g
All these words I don't just say
#g f# g f# e
And nothing else matters

#e f# g e
Trust I seek and I find in you
#h g a a e f# g g
Every day for us something new
#f# g f# g f# e f# g e
Open mind for a different view
#g f# g
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

1, 2,

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know
