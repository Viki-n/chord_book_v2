House of Memories
Panic! at the disco

F#m                            Hm
 If you're a lover, you should know
                            E
The lonely moments just get lonelier
                     A
The longer you're in love
                  D
Than if you were alone
              Hm
Memories turn into daydreams
  C#7
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?


     F#m     D          A
*R:* Baby we built this house
   C#7 F#m
On memories
        D       A
Take my picture now
         C#7
Shake it til you see it
F#m            D
 And when your fantasies
A            C#7
 Become your legacy
D            C#7
Promise me a place
                     F#m
In your house of memories

F#m           C#7
Oh [D]Wo[A]oh Wo[F#m]oh
D       C#7
Wo[A]oh Wo[F#m]oh


I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool

*R:*

         F#m
*Bridge:* Those thoughts of
A
 Past lovers
D               Cdim  C#7
 They'll always haunt me
F#m
 I wish I
A
 Could believe
D            Cdim  C#7
 You'd never wrong me
F#m
 Then will you
A
 Remember
D          Cdim C#7
 Me in the same wa[D]y
               C#7
 As I remember you

*R:* ...Promise me a place

*R:*
