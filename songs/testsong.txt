[E]I hear the drums [G#mi]echoin to[C#mi]night
[E]She has only [D]whispers of some [F#mi]quiet conver[C#mi]sa[D]tion[F#mi]
[E]She's coming [G#mi]in twelve thirty [C#mi]flight, the [E]moonlit wings
Re[D]flect the stars that [F#mi7]guide me toward sal[C#mi]va[D]tion[F#mi]
[E]I stopped an old [G#mi]man along the [C#mi]way
[E]Hoping to find some [D]old forgotten [F#mi]words of ancient [C#mi]melo[D]dies[F#mi]
[E]He turned to [G#mi]me as if to [C#mi]say  hurry boy it's [D]waiting there for [F#mi]you


R: [Hmi]Gonna take a [G]lot to drag me a[D]way from [A]you
[Hmi]There's nothing that a [G]hundred men or [D]more could ever [A]do
[Hmi]I bless the [G]rains down in [D]Afri[A]ca
[Hmi]Gonna take some [G]time to do the [D]things we never [F#mi]had  [A]  [Hmi]    [D]  [F#mi]


The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as kilimangiaro rises like olimpus above the seranget-ti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
