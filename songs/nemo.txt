Nemo 
Nightwish


Dm         C
This is me for forever
Bb              Dm 
One of the lost ones
Dm                C 
The one without a name
           Gm              Bb C
Without an honest heart as compass

This is me for forever
One without a name
Despite the last endeavour
To find the missing lifeline

    Dm                          F 
R1: Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
          C              Dm
Oh, how I wish to dream again
                            F 
My loving heart lost in the dark
             C            Dm 
For hope I'd give my everything

My flower withered between
The pages two and three
The once and forever Blue
Gone with my sins

Fm                  Eb
Walk the dark path, swim with angels
Db 
Call the past for help
Bbm                Fm 
Touch me with your love
      Bbm           Db   Eb
And reveal to me my true name

R1:

R2: Oh, how I wish for soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
Once and for all and all for once
Nemo my name forevermore

Fm   Eb      Fm 
Nemo sailing home
Db   Eb      Fm 
Nemo letting go

Fm Ab Eb 

R1, R2

...My name forevermore
