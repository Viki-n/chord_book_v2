See the soldiers at war, on the battlefield,
they've got more than a gun, my whiskey is their shield.
Look at the crippled, the wounded down the street,
a passport to hell and a bottle to their feet.
You don't leave a child or sweetheart behind.
This is our secret vow so boy don't be blind.

*R:* \dots What I share with you my lad, what I share with you\dots
