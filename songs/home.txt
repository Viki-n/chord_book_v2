Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess
                Cm                G
This avoids the stress of falling out of it

Are you tired of me yet? I'm a little sick right now but I swear
               Cm            G
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

    Em C     G
*R* Ooooo, I'll cut my hair
Em C  G
Ooooo, To make you stare
Em C  G
Ooooo, I'll hide my chest
         Em                         C          G
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here


Turn off your porcelain face, I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colours enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead? Sometimes I think I'm dead
Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet


*R:* Ooooo, My eyes went dark
Ooooo, I don't know where
Ooooo, My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

             Em
*Bridge:* /: Get a load of this monster
A
He doesn't know how to communicate
C
His mind is in a different place
G                                Cm
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space
Em
Get a load of this trainwreck
A                                               C
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
G
Welcome him with open :/ arms

*R:* Ooooo,  Time is
Ooooo,  Slowly
Ooooo,  Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place
