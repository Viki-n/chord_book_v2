Those were the days 
Mary Hopkin


Am 
 Once upon a time there was a tavern,
                                 Dm 
where we used to raise a glass or two.
                                Am 
Remember how we laughed away the hours,
    H7                                       E 
and dreamed of all the great things we would do.

                 Am 
R: Those were the days, my friend,
                  Dm 
we thought they'd never end,
              G         G7        C 
we'd sing and dance for ever and a day;
              Dm 
We'd live the life we choose,
               Am 
we,d fight and never loose,
            E                           Am 
For we were young, and sure to have our way.
                           Dm 
La la la la la la la la la la la la
               E                           Am 
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days.

Then the busy years went rushing by us.
We lost our starty notions on the way.
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern,
we'd smiled at one another, and we'd say:

R:

Just tonight I stood before the tavern.
Nothing seemed the way it used to be.
In the glass I saw a strange reflection,
was that lonley woman really me?

R:

Through the door there came familiar laughter.
I saw your face and heard you call my name.
Oh, my friend, we're older, but no wiser.
For in our hearts the dream are still the same.

R:
