California Dreamin
Mamas and Papas


                   Am   G 
All the leaves are brown [F] 
        G      E7
and the sky is grey 
F               C   E7 
I've been for a walk [Am]
                 E 
on a winter's day [E7]

                   Am  G 
I'd be be safe and warm [F] 
     G        E7
if I was in L.A.
           Am      G 
California dreaming [F] 
   G               E7
on such a winter's day 

Stopped into a church  
I passes along the way 
Well I got down on my knees  
and I pretend to pray 

You know the preacher likes the cold,  
he knows I'm gonna stay 
California dreaming 
on such a winter's day 

All the leaves are brown  
and the sky is grey 
I've been for a walk 
on a winter's day 

If I didn't tell her  
I could leave today 
California dreaming  
on such a winter's day  

   G               Am  G 
on such a winter's day  [F]
   G               Fmaj7   Cmaj7 
on such a winter's day [G]
