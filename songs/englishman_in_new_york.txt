I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
cos' I'm an Englishman in New York

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York

whoaa I'm an alien
I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
whoaa I'm an alien
I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

If "manners maketh man." as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say

whoaa I'm an alien
I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
whoaa I'm an alien
I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety

You could end up as the only one

Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society

At night a candle's brighter than the sun

(musical piece)

Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say
Be yourself no matter what they say

(Be yourself no matter what they say 9x)
whoaa I'm an alien
I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York 4x
