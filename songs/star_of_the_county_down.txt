Near to Banbridge town, in the County Down, one morning in July
       Emi                 G          D          G             D         Emi 
Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen and she smiled as she passed me by
    G                       D                     G            Emi       D 
She looked so neat from her two white feet to the sheen of her nut-brown hair
         Emi                 G        D            Emi        C   D    Emi 
Sure the coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself, to make sure I was standing there

No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen that I met in County Down


As she onward sped, sure I shook my head and I gazed with a feeling quare
And I said, says I to a passer-by, who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?
He smiled at me and with pride says he, that's the gem of Irelands crown
She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann, |she's the star of the County Down

R:

She'd a soft brown eye and a look so sly and a smile like the rose in June
And you held each note from her lily-white throat, as she lilted an Irish tune
At the pattern dance you were in trance as she tripped through a jig or reel
When her eyes she'd roll, she would lift soul as your heart she would likely steal

R:

At the harvest fair she'll be surely there and I'll dress my Sunday clothes
With my shoes shon bright and my hat cocked right |for a smile from the nut-brown Rose
No pipe I smoke, no horse I'll yoke, let my plough with the rust turns brown
Till a smiling bride  by my own fireside sits the star of the County Down

R:
