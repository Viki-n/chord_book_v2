Remember me to one who lives there, 
Dm       C   Dm C   Dm   C  Dm 
she once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seams nor needlework,
then she ll be a true love of mine

(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)

Tell her to find me an acre of land,
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strand,
then she ll be a true love of mine

(On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
(Washed is the ground with so many tears)
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)

Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather,
parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather,
then she ll be a true love of mine

(War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
