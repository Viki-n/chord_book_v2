Another head hangs lowly child is slowly taken
Em               C                   G               D/F# 
And the violence caused such silence who are we mistaken
        Em                        C 
But you see it's not me, it's not my family,
        G                               D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they are fighting
           Em              C 
With their tanks and their bombs
        G                            D/F# 
in your head, in your head, the are crying.

           Em            C             G            D/F# 
R: In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie
               Em            C             G            D/F# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie

Anothers mother's breaking, heart is taking over.
When the violence caused silence, we must be mistaken.
It's the same old theme since 1916,
in your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs en' their guns,
In your head, in your head, they're dying.
