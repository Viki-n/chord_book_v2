Let it go

    Emi                     C 
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D               Asus4   Ami 
Not a footprint to be seen    
  Emi           C 
A kingdom of isolation
       D                  Asus4    A 
And it looks like I'm the queen    
Emi           C                 D                Asus4  Ami 
  The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside   
Emi                D                     A 
  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

D                                 C 
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    D 
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    C 
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
               Cadd2 
Well, now they know

          G          Dsus4/F# 
R: Let it go, let it go
      Emi7            Cadd9 
Can't hold it back anymore
       G          Dsus4/F# 
Let it go, let it go
      Emi7             Cadd9 
Turn away and slam the door
G       Dsus4/F#          Emi7     Cadd9 
I don't care what they're going to say
        Hmi7       A#7 
Let the storm rage on
    C 
The cold never bothered me anyway


It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

R: Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

*Bridge:*
C 
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D 
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Emi       C              D               Ami    C 
I'm never going back, the past is in the past   

R:Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
