Never gonna run a[G]round and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
            Emi     Ami 
Never gonna say goodbye
            Fmaj7  G       Emi  Ami 
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've know each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Pre-Chorus 3 = Pre-Chorus 1
*R:* 3x
