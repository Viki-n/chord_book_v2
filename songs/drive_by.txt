       Ami                           F 
On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you
C                          G 
I guess that's déja vu But I thought this can't be true
      Ami                      F 
Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
   C                           G 
Or where ever to get away from me

Dmi                   F 
 Oh but that one night Was more than just right
Ami                G 
 I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Dmi                  F 
 Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
E                 E7 
 Because I really fell for you

    F                C                     G                   Ami
*R:* Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya This is not a drive by
F               C                   G                    G#dim 
 Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my love
F                 C                    G 
 When you move me everything is groovy They don't like it sue me
Ami          G     F               C 
 The way you do me Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya
Dmi                 E7 
This is not a drive by

On the other side of a downward spiral My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away But now here you are again
So let's skip the "How you been"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last

Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't neeed you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

          Dmi      Ami        F      G  F
*Bridge:* Please believe that when I leave
        E             Ami 
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for
G 
You And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you
