*Intro:*[D] [F#mi] x4


E                G#mi     C#mi 
I hear the drums echoin tonight
E            D                F#mi        C#mi     F#mi 
She has only whispers of some quiet conversa[D]tion
E            G#mi             C#mi        E 
She's coming in twelve thirty flight, the moonlit wings
  D                    F#mi7              C#mi     F#mi 
Reflect the stars that guide me toward salva[D]tion
E                G#mi          C#mi 
I stopped an old man along the way
E                   D             F#mi             C#mi       F#mi 
Hoping to find some old forgotten words of ancient melo[D]dies
E            G#mi        C#mi                D                 F#mi 
He turned to me as if to say  hurry boy it's waiting there for you


   Hmi          G               D        A 
*R:* Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Hmi                    G              D               A 
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Hmi         G             D   A 
I bless the rains down in Africa
Hmi             G              D               F#mi A Hmi D F#mi 
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had          


The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
I know that I must do what's right
Sure as kilimangiaro rises like olimpus above the seranget-ti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

*R:*

*Interlude:*
E   G#mi   C#mi   E   D   F#mi   C#mi    D   F#mi 
E  G#mi  C#mi             D                 F#mi 
          hurry boy it's waiting there for you
