Falling Slowly 
Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova


! Intro: C F Am F F

C               F 
I dont know you but I want you
All the more for that
Words fall through me and always fool me
And I cant react

Am         G      F        G               Am
Games that never amount to more than their worth
     G               F 
Will play themselves out

     C                 G                 Am
*R:* Take this sinking boat and point it home
                F 
We've still got time
C                  G                F 
Raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
F 
You've made it known

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And i'm painted black

You have suffered enough and warred with yourself
It's time that you won

*R:*

C               G         Am
Falling slowly, sing your melody

F 
I'll sing it loud
